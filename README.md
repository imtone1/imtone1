# Hello World! 👋

I'm Irina Tatti, a blend of a healthcare professional, tech enthusiast, and a bit of a music geek.

## A Bit More About Me

### 📚 Education

I'm currently pursuing an MBA in Project Management at Turku University of Applied Sciences. My love for continuous learning has also led me to a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at JAMK University of Applied Sciences.

### 📝 Master's Thesis on the Horizon

I'm currently working on my master's thesis focused on "Landing Page Content Creation using ChatGPT". This involves exploring how ChatGPT can be leveraged to produce quality, targeted content for business landing pages. You can catch a glimpse of my journey and insights at this dedicated page [opinnaytetyoteoria.vercel.app](https://opinnaytetyoteoria.vercel.app/), where I delve into the utility and risks of ChatGPT, its efficient use, and the nuances of landing page content creation. 

### 💻 Tech Savvy

I've got my hands dirty with languages like Python, JavaScript and C#, and have dabbled in software development frameworks and technologies including Django, Node.js, ASP.NET, and more. Cybersecurity? Data Analytics? Been there, studied that!

###  🏥 Healthcare Heartbeat

With a background as a public health nurse and specialized skills in occupational health, I blend empathy and care with every project I undertake.

### 🌟 What I'm up to

Balancing the books on project management while tinkering with code, and sometimes strumming a tune or two. I'm always on the lookout for projects where health meets tech, or where I can channel my diverse skill set into creating something unique.

###  Let's Connect
Feel free to explore my repositories – a mix of academic projects, personal tinkering, and a snapshot of my journey in tech and beyond.
